# Programming Paradigms - HW1

---

### Question 1 (20 points)
Implement a function `isPhoneNumber()` in Python or any language of your choice that checks whether a given string matches the pattern of a phone number (e.g., 415-555-4242). Use regular expressions for pattern matching.

#### Task:
Write a script to match phone numbers using regular expressions. Test your program on a sample search string containing a phone number.

### Question 2 (20 points)
Create a program that mimics the Unix `tail` command to display:
- The last n lines of a file specified as a command line argument.
- Error handling for non-existent files or missing command line arguments.
- Extension to display:
  - The first n lines of the file.
  - The middle n lines of the file.

### Question 3 (20 points)
Write a Java function `SpOdd` that takes an array of integers as input and returns an array containing only the odd numbers in the original array, maintaining the order. Include a `main` function to test your implementation.

#### Sample Output:
```
Original Array: [3, 8, 5, 7, 1, 9, 2]
Odd elements in the array: [3, 5, 7, 1, 9]
```
Please submit your `.java` file.

### Question 4 (20 points)
Write Verilog code to describe specific functions. (Details omitted here for brevity.)

---

### Question 5 (20 points)
Complete a case study on computer architecture, focusing on the CPU, memory, and the bus. Include details about registers, ALU, and instruction sets, particularly the characteristics of a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor.

---

#### Note:
For each question, ensure your code is functional and well-documented. Use appropriate file formats for submission as specified. If you choose to use a language other than the suggested one, provide clear instructions for running and testing your code.
